It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.\r\n\r\n##Instructions and Navigation\r\n\r\nAll of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.\r\nYou will see something similar to the following:\r\n```\r\n public function __construct($id, $module, ShoppingCart $cart, $config = [])\r\n    {\r\n        $this->cart = $cart;\r\n        parent::__construct($id, $module, $config);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function behaviors()\r\n    {\r\n        return [\r\n            'verbs' => [\r\n                'class' => VerbFilter::className(),\r\n                'actions' => [\r\n                    'delete' => ['post'],\r\n                ],\r\n            ],\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n####Author Instructions\r\n\r\n\r\n HHVM is installed.\r\n\r\n Running PHP web scripts with HHVM is done by having your webserver talk to HHVM over FastCGI. Install nginx or Apache, and then:\r\n* $ sudo /usr/share/hhvm/install_fastcgi.sh\r\n* $ sudo /etc/init.d/hhvm restart\r\n* (if using nginx)  $ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart\r\n* (if using apache) $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache restart\r\n\r\nDetailed FastCGI directions are online at:\r\n* https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/wiki/FastCGI\r\n\r\nIf you're using HHVM to run web scripts, you probably want it to start at boot:\r\n* $ sudo update-rc.d hhvm defaults\r\n\r\nRunning command-line scripts with HHVM requires no special setup:\r\n* $ hhvm whatever.php\r\n\r\nYou can use HHVM for /usr/bin/php even if you have php-cli installed:\r\n* $ sudo /usr/bin/update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/php php /usr/bin/hhvm 60\r\n\r\n####Software and Hardware list\r\n| Chapter  | Software required | OS required            |\r\n| -------- | ------------------| ------------           |\r\n| 1 to 12 |  Web Server, Database Server, PHP, Yii2          | Windows/Mac/Ubuntu     |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Related Products\r\n* [Yii 1.1 Application Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/yii-11-application-development-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781849515481)\r\n\r\n* [Yii Application Development Cookbook - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/yii-application-development-cookbook-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781782163107)\r\n\r\n* [Web Application Development with Yii 2 and PHP](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/web-application-development-yii-2-and-php?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783981885)\r\n\r\n### Suggestions and Feedback \r\n [Click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5qwunkGf6PUvzPirPDtuy1Du5Rlzew23UBp2S-P3wB-GcwQ/viewform)  if you have any feedback or suggestions.\r\n",
